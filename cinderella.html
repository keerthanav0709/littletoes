    <h1>Cinderella</h1>

    <p>
      Once upon a time, there lived a kind and beautiful girl named Cinderella. After her mother passed away, her father remarried a woman with two daughters who were mean and jealous of Cinderella's beauty and goodness.
    </p>

    <p>
      When her father died, Cinderella was forced to become a servant in her own home. She cooked, cleaned, and slept by the fireplace, which made her clothes dirty and her face covered in ash — hence the name “Cinderella.”
    </p>

    <p>
      One day, the king held a grand ball to find a bride for his son. Cinderella wanted to go, but her stepmother wouldn’t allow it. While her stepsisters went to the ball, Cinderella was left crying at home.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suddenly, a Fairy Godmother appeared! With a wave of her wand, she turned Cinderella’s ragged dress into a beautiful gown, a pumpkin into a carriage, and mice into horses. But there was one rule — she must return before midnight, or the magic would disappear.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the ball, the prince was enchanted by Cinderella’s grace and beauty. They danced all night. But as the clock struck midnight, Cinderella ran away, leaving behind only a glass slipper.
    </p>

    <p>
      The prince searched far and wide. Every woman tried on the slipper, but it fit no one — until he reached Cinderella’s home. The slipper fit her perfectly, and her true identity was revealed. The prince married her, and they lived happily ever after.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Moral:</strong> Kindness and inner beauty will always shine through and be rewarded in the end.</p>
