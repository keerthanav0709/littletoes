    <h1>Goldilocks and the Three Bears</h1>

    <p>
      Once upon a time, in a cozy little house deep in the forest, there lived three bears — Papa Bear, Mama Bear, and Baby Bear. Each had their own bowl of porridge, their own chair, and their own bed.
    </p>

    <p>
      One morning, the bears made porridge for breakfast, but it was too hot to eat. So they decided to go for a walk in the forest while it cooled down.
    </p>

    <p>
      Meanwhile, a curious little girl named Goldilocks was wandering through the woods. She saw the bears' cottage and, drawn by curiosity and hunger, she knocked on the door. When no one answered, she gently pushed it open and stepped inside.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the kitchen, she saw three bowls of porridge. She tasted the first one. “Too hot!” she exclaimed. She tried the second. “Too cold!” But when she tried the third, she smiled, “Just right,” and ate it all up.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then she saw three chairs. The first was too big, the second also too big, but the third — Baby Bear’s chair — was just right. She sat down... and *crack!* The chair broke under her.
    </p>

    <p>
      Feeling tired, she climbed the stairs and found three beds. The first was too hard. The second was too soft. But the third bed was just right, and Goldilocks fell fast asleep.
    </p>

    <p>
      Soon, the three bears returned. “Someone’s been eating my porridge,” growled Papa Bear. “Someone’s been sitting in my chair,” said Mama Bear. “And someone broke mine!” cried Baby Bear.
    </p>

    <p>
      Upstairs, they found Goldilocks fast asleep in Baby Bear’s bed. She woke up to three bear faces staring at her! Frightened, she jumped up and ran out of the house, never to return again.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Moral:</strong> Respect others’ belongings and always be mindful of your actions.</p>
