    <h1>The Lion and the Mouse</h1>

    <p>
      Deep in the heart of a lush, green jungle, a mighty lion was enjoying a peaceful nap under a shady tree. The sun was warm, the air calm, and birds chirped lazily in the background. As the lion slept, a tiny mouse scurried through the grass, playing joyfully.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without noticing, the mouse ran up the lion's tail, across his back, and even over his nose. Suddenly, the lion woke with a loud growl, his golden eyes glaring. He swiped his powerful paw and caught the mouse between his claws.
    </p>

    <p>
      "How dare you disturb the King of the Jungle!" roared the lion. "Now I shall eat you for your foolishness."
    </p>

    <p>
      The poor mouse trembled and squeaked, "Oh mighty Lion, please forgive me! I didn’t mean to wake you. I was just playing. If you let me go, I promise I’ll help you someday."
    </p>

    <p>
      The lion paused. A mouse? Helping a lion? It was so ridiculous that he burst out laughing. "You? Help me? That’s the funniest thing I’ve heard all day!" he chuckled. But feeling generous, he lifted his paw and let the mouse run free.
    </p>

    <p>
      Days passed, and one afternoon, the lion was walking through the jungle when he fell into a hunter's trap. A heavy net fell upon him, and no matter how hard he struggled, he couldn’t escape. His roars echoed through the forest.
    </p>

    <p>
      The little mouse heard the familiar roar and ran to the scene. Without hesitation, he gnawed at the thick ropes with his sharp teeth. Bit by bit, the net loosened and finally fell apart.
    </p>

    <p>
      The lion stood up, amazed and grateful. "You saved my life, little friend," he said softly. "I never thought someone so small could be such a big help."
    </p>

    <p>
      The mouse smiled, "I told you, one day I’d repay your kindness."
    </p>

    <p><strong>Moral:</strong> Kindness is never wasted. Even the smallest creatures can make a big difference.</p>
