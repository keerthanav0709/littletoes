    <h1>The Tortoise and the Hare</h1>

    <p>
      In a peaceful forest filled with playful animals and rustling leaves, there lived a proud hare who loved boasting about how fast he could run. “I’m the quickest animal in the entire forest,” he would say with a grin. “No one can beat me in a race!”
    </p>

    <p>
      The other animals grew tired of his arrogance, and one day, a quiet tortoise said calmly, “Hare, I may not be fast, but I challenge you to a race.”
    </p>

    <p>
      The forest burst into laughter. The hare couldn’t believe it. “You? Race me?” he chuckled. “This is going to be too easy!” But the tortoise simply nodded, “Let’s meet at the big oak tree tomorrow morning. Let everyone witness the race.”
    </p>

    <p>
      The next day, animals gathered to watch. At the signal, the hare sped off like a flash, leaving the tortoise far behind. Confident of his victory, the hare soon stopped under a tree and said, “This tortoise is so slow, I have plenty of time for a nap.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Meanwhile, the tortoise kept moving — slow, steady, determined. He never stopped or looked back. He just kept walking toward the finish line.
    </p>

    <p>
      The hare slept longer than he expected. When he finally woke up and stretched, he saw the tortoise near the finish line. Panicked, he dashed at full speed — but it was too late.
    </p>

    <p>
      The tortoise crossed the finish line just as the hare arrived. The forest erupted in cheers. The hare was humbled, and the tortoise smiled kindly.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Slow and steady wins the race,” the tortoise said softly.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Moral:</strong> Consistency and perseverance can beat even the strongest talent when paired with overconfidence and laziness.</p>
