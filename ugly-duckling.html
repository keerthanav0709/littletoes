    <h1>The Ugly Duckling</h1>

    <p>
      Once upon a time, in a quiet countryside, a mother duck was waiting for her eggs to hatch. One by one, the eggs cracked open, revealing fluffy little ducklings. But one egg was different — it was larger and took longer to hatch.
    </p>

    <p>
      When it finally opened, out came a big, grey bird. He was not like the others. The other ducklings and animals on the farm teased him and called him “ugly.” The poor duckling felt sad and lonely, so he decided to run away.
    </p>

    <p>
      The little duckling wandered through fields and forests, facing harsh weather and rejection wherever he went. Seasons passed, and he grew bigger and stronger, but still felt out of place and unloved.
    </p>

    <p>
      One day, he saw a group of beautiful white birds gliding gracefully on a lake. As he approached, he saw his reflection in the water and gasped — he was no longer an ugly duckling, but a beautiful swan!
    </p>

    <p>
      The other swans welcomed him warmly. For the first time, he felt loved and accepted. He had found where he truly belonged.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Moral:</strong> Don’t judge by appearance. Everyone grows in their own time and becomes who they are meant to be.</p>
